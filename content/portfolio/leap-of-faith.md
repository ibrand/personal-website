Leap of Faith was my high school senior film project that played at (3?) film festivals around the country.

The film is a whimsical trip through the beginnings of a first relationship. This project was my first exposure to mixed media motion graphics. The film itself was shot on (16mm?) color film and all of the animated elements were hand-drawn on a tablet.
