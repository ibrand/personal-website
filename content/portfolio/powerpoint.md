Powerpoint was a final for a mixed media studies class I took my senior year of college.

In the video, shapes haphazardly orbit around a drill. The shapes are designed to fit together, and yet they consistently narrowly miss alignment until one very brief moment that leads to them separating once again.

I wanted to create a small self-contained system with a set of objectives and rules with this project. I also wanted to play with the counterpoint of the mechanized modernized world and they playful world of shape and form. Both object types are highly contrasted texturally but both have roots in math and structural thinking.

The piece is called Powerpoint as a way of poking fun at what projected presentations can be. Instead of a standard powerpoint presentation that is meant to _convey_ information, Powerpoint is meant to sit in the background and provide nothing of substance to the viewer.

If anything, it's a little dissatisfying since the most pleasing moment of alignment in the clip happens very briefly before undoing itself and moving backwards.
