Purple Crayon is a blogging platform that I developed with Alex Katz. It's a NodeJS app that runs on Express, and uses Passport for user authentication.

In addition to supporting account creation and authentication we used Express to give each user their own subdomain:
{{< highlight go >}}
<username>.purplecrayon.me
{{< / highlight >}}

Purple Crayon was a summer project with the goal of gaining an understanding of web development as a end-to-end process. Neither of us had ever built a project that used server client architecture and the project was at least as much about learning through doing as it was about the final product.
