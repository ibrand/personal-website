This 3D render was used in LumenEd's final pitch deck to acquire funding from Oberlin College's LaunchU program to start their company.

LumenEd is a company that aims to provide a viable multi-media educational experience to schools in India through an affordable projector unit with an onboard rasberry pi making the unit double as a computer.

The render was meant to showcase what an intial prototype of the LumenEd projector could look like. It was based off of descriptions of the color, functionality, and aesthetic from meeting with the team and doing some sketches.
