This animation was designed for the homepage of a Project Muses's website.

Project Muses was a non-profit working to get off the ground aiming to provide a platform for musicians to crowd source funds from donors for music instruments and lessons.

I worked with designer Jacob Gilbert who had designed brand assets for the project to bring his color palettes and logos to life. Sam (the lead in the video) was based off of the logo seen at the end and the rest of the world and art style was built around him.
