Spilt Milk was my senior project for my Oberlin College Cinema Studies major.

It's a comedy of miscommunications that uses visual metaphors to bring to light the ways that the characters are speaking right past each other. It's a film about the act of explaining without listening and about the non-verbal ways that we express ourselves to the people we care about.
