This motion graphic was commissioned by a professor in the Oberlin Cinema Studies department to be the title text for a documentary on a program called Oasis that the department was piloting that year.

Oasis was an interdisciplinary program meant for artists to collaborate on one large theater piece. The overarching theme of the program was "water" and thus the graphic stays short and sweet while still capturing a liquid texture.
